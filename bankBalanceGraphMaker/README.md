To get the files, go to ING, select one account (this must be done for all accounts), go to transaction history, select the maximum interval (24 months), click to add balance, select CSV, and download.

Note that currently it is not possible to chain multiple files for one account.
All files should have the same period of time

NOTE! Rename the file for EUR account to contain "EUR" string in it.
