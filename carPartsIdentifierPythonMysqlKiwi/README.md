The project consists of an application that helps to identify the variants of parts compatible with a car whose data (make, model, fuel, engine capacity) are entered by the user.
Based on this information entered, with the help of the information already stored in the database, the engine code of the car is identified, and with it the part codes for this car will be identified.
This project is a demo, so we only added 4 tracks: pollen filter, fuel filter, air filter, oil filter, but can be expanded by additional popular database. With a part code, for example of the oil filter, one looks for compatible variants from different suppliers. The client chooses the right piece for his needs and sees the stores where this piece is available, where the customer can reserve it. (update to the quantity available in the store)
